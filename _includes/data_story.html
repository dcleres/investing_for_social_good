                    In order to give some deeper insights to the information that we generated but also to make our workflow
                    easier to understand for the reader, we decided to split our data story in smaller data stories
                    called <i>substories</i> which are linked. The substories were set up in such a way that they all
                    answer one of our research questions. In fact, the whole substory in built around this question.
                    The first part of the substory is used to introduce and state the problem that we want to answer and
                    why it is interesting to studies this topic. These introduction should serve as teaser for the reader.
                    The used dataset is also explicitly mentioned in each document. This should make it possible for the
                    reader to eventually reproduce our experiments or at least to understand which dataset and which part of
                    it was used to get the information that we want to show. Finally, the major part of the substory is
                    obviously dedicated to the graphs that we produced to answer the research question. Each graph comes
                    with a description of the phenomena but also with an interpretation of the results in order to conclude
                    something from the data regarding the research question.

                        The data story presented of the Investing for Social Good project is composed of six questions.
                        The First part, and so, the first research question of the project was described to in the
                        <a href="#portfolioModal4" class="research-link" data-toggle="modal">Who owns Who?</a> substory.
                        The aim of this story was to give to the reader a better insight of the data. Furthermore, the
                        way the data have been cleaned was presented. From the data it saw possible to observe that, for example,
                        the lowest scoring investor had a very specialized investment strategy (event-driven investing).
                        On the other end of the spectrum, the highest scoring investor, Aetna Inc, is a healthcare company,
                        and is thus intrinsically driven to invest based on values aligned with social impact outcomes.
                        <br>
                        After this first part dedicated to data exploration, the second substory defines in a first step
                        the terms ethics and assests since these terms will follow us all along of our journey through the
                        data. <a href="#portfolioModal2" class="research-link" data-toggle="modal">The Asset Manager's Portfolio</a> substory,
                        could show the popularity of the high and low impact stocks and we ended up showing that an investor
                        could easily end up selecting a portfolio with more high social impact investments simply based
                        on looking for stocks with high historical financial growth - technology companies such as Amazon and Apple.
                        Nevertheless, until now, only the recent data was processed. In order to determine if investments
                        in social good are a recent trend or if there is a tradition to invest in ethically favorable assets
                        we chose to compare the data of the previous year. By doing so in the <a href="#portfolioModal7" class="research-link" data-toggle="modal">Towards Social Good </a> substory,
                        it was possible to see that investors do not seem to be, as a general trend, shifting towards higher social impact investments.
