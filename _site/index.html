                        Asset managers are increasingly challenged by their investors to manage their portfolios for social
                        impact. However, it is non-trivial for investors and investment managers to maintain regular
                        oversight over the social impact composition of their portfolios. The U.S. Securities and
                        Exchange Commission’s (SEC’s) EDGAR maintains a digital record of the portfolio filings of
                        publicly traded asset managers.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        One way to track at which extent the investors, and to a greater extent, the great public is interested in social good
                        projects is by analysing the data from social media platforms such as Twitter. With this information,
                        one could also link the social opinion about a given company and how much the enterprise invests in
                        social good.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In this research project, the term social good was defined according to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG).
                        These SDG where defined are a collection of 17 global goals set by the United Nations General Assembly in 2015.
                        They aim to "transform our World: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development." That has been shortened to "2030 Agenda."
                        The goals are broad and interdependent, yet each has a separate list of targets to achieve.
                        Achieving all 169 targets would signal accomplishing all 17 goals. The SDGs cover social and
                        economic development issues including poverty, hunger, health, education, global warming,
                        gender equality, water, sanitation, energy, urbanization, environment and social justice.
                        In the frame of this project, investments in social good were defined as being an investment in
                        any of the 17 different goals stated by the United Nations.
                        <br>

                        From these SDG's, we decided to put the focus on three following major targets:

                            America's ranking for the most just companies. JUST Capital measures and ranks companies on
                            the issues Americans care about most so the Americans can then act on that knowledge.
                            The aim is to influence purchase decisions, investment dollars, career choices of the people
                            that are living and working in the US. Thus people should have the power to make the world a more just place.
                            <br>
                            JUST Capital was co-founded in 2013 by a group of people from the world of business, finance,
                            and civil society. The organization as a not-for-profit registered charity, the founders
                            ensured that JUST Capital would be exclusively geared towards achieving its mission. JUST Capital
                            ranking annually all the companies in the US in their annual report.

                            This ranking was then used by our group as a factor for the <i>Social Good</i> score of each company.
                            Details about the calculation of this score are given bellow in the <i>The Ethics of Investing</i>

                    <h4 class="introduction-heading">
                        <p style="text-align:justify">
                            For this project, two datatsets were used. The first dataset consisted of the
                            <a href="https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?company=&CIK=&type=13F&owner=include&count=40&action=getcurrent">U.S. Securities
                                and Exchange Commission (SEC)</a> archives. It was possible generate a
                            .csv-like file listing, by company and date since the URLs in the SEC's archives, where the
                            investment portfolio filings are stored, has consistently structured text and HTML table data.
                            We were able to automate the extraction and so to get the type and scope of different types of asset
                            manager investment holdings (what companies they invested in, the size and value of each investment).
                            This data can be enriched by processing additional social data from twitter related to portfolio companies
                            into signals of their social impact and mapping these social impact signals to investment portfolios.
                            <br>
                            Based on this data from investment portfolio filings, we could identify and analyze investments
                            made in companies that pursue goals related to social good from all different kinds of industries.
                            <br>
                            Nevertheless, one need to be careful with the interpretation of the data. This data set contained
                            biases that one need to be aware of before drawing general conclusions from the data.
                            First, the data is collected quarterly and contains information about all the major players
                            of the US stock market. It would have been interesting to have the same kind of information
                            about Switzerland and the rest of the world also. However, the SEC dataset was the most
                            complete and consistent information we were able to find. Therefore, any conclusion that we could
                            make is likely to be true from the USA but not necessarily for the rest of the world. <br>

                            Secondly, the dataset contains only the institutional investment managers with holdings over 100M <br>

                            Furthermore, the <i>13F form</i> is required to be filed within 45 days of the end of a calendar quarter
                            (which should be considered as significant information latency) only reports long positions
                            (not short) different investment managers pursue different strategies with may bias results.
                            However, the vast majority of investment managers rely significantly on long positions for significant
                            portion of fund performance. <br>

                            Another drawback is that the 13F form does not reveal international holdings (except for
                            American depositary receipts) and excludes total portfolio value and percentage allocation of
                            each stock listed <br>

                            The Section 13(f) securities generally include equity securities that trade on an exchange (including Nasdaq),
                            certain equity options and warrants, shares of closed-end investment companies, and certain convertible debt securities.
                            Shares of open-end investment companies (i.e. mutual funds) are not Section 13(f) securities

                            Finally, it is necessery to point out at 13F does not represent the whole portfolio of the investos - it's a past snapshot.

                            that it would be wiser and sufficient to take 10-days samples through the year 2017. This made
                            the calculation feasible in Pandas.
                            Since we were looking for information about investors and companies in the USA, we decided to
                            only look at the tweet in English. This reduces the number of tweet per day by roughly 70% the majority
                            of the Tweet are written in the mother tongue of the user (Chinese, Japanese, German, ...)

                    In order to give some deeper insights to the information that we generated but also to make our workflow
                    easier to understand for the reader, we decided to split our data story in smaller data stories
                    called <i>substories</i> which are linked. The substories were set up in such a way that they all
                    answer one of our research questions. In fact, the whole substory in built around this question.
                  
                  <br/>
                    The first part of the substory is used to introduce and state the problem that we want to answer and
                    why it is interesting to studies this topic. These introduction should serve as teaser for the reader.
                    The used dataset is also explicitly mentioned in each document. This should make it possible for the
                    reader to eventually reproduce our experiments or at least to understand which dataset and which part of
                    it was used to get the information that we want to show. 
                  <br/>
                  
                  Finally, the major part of the substory is
                    obviously dedicated to the graphs that we produced to answer the research question. Each graph comes
                    with a description of the phenomena but also with an interpretation of the results in order to conclude
                    something from the data regarding the research question.

                <h4 class="introduction-heading">
                    <p style="text-align:justify">
                        Ultimately, our data story documents our journey into understanding the social good impact performance of large asset manager investors, 
                      and how the prevailing public opinion supporting socially responsible investing may have influenced asset managers to be more socially impactful. 
                      In order to explore these topics, we composed five questions, each of which are documented below as a data substory. 
                      <br>
                      We first seek to understand the nature of our asset management investor social impact dataset. 
                        In this First part, the first research question of the project was described to in the
                        <a href="#portfolioModal4" class="research-link" data-toggle="modal">Who owns Who?</a> substory.
                        The aim of this story was to give to the reader a better insight of the data. Furthermore, the
                        way the data have been cleaned was presented. From the data it saw possible to observe that, for example,
                        the lowest scoring investor had a very specialized investment strategy (event-driven investing).
                        On the other end of the spectrum, the highest scoring investor, Aetna Inc, is a healthcare company,
                        and is thus intrinsically driven to invest based on values aligned with social impact outcomes.
                        <br>
                        After this first part dedicated to data exploration, the second substory defines in a first step
                        the terms ethics and assets since these terms will follow us all along of our journey through the
                        data. <a href="#portfolioModal2" class="research-link" data-toggle="modal">The Asset Manager's Portfolio</a> substory,
                        could show the popularity of the high and low impact stocks and we ended up showing that an investor
                        could easily end up selecting a portfolio with more high social impact investments simply based
                        on looking for stocks with high historical financial growth - technology companies such as Amazon and Apple.
                        Nevertheless, until now, only the recent data was processed. In order to determine if investments
                        in social good are a recent trend or if there is a tradition to invest in ethically favorable assets
                        we chose to compare the data of the previous year. By doing so in the <a href="#portfolioModal7" class="research-link" data-toggle="modal">Towards Social Good </a> substory,
                        it was possible to see that investors do not seem to be, as a general trend, shifting towards higher social impact investments.

                <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusions</h2>
                <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted">
                    1. Consider what ethical means
                    There are many different criteria of “ethical” under which to categorise a fund and businesses that involve nuclear energy, animal testing or tobacco are some of the commonly screened-out industries when people are thinking of ethical investment. But before you can sensibly choose an investment fund that may match your profile, you need to ask yourself if you are against an alleged cause for a higher purpose or just for the sake of going against it.
                    Socially Conscious Investing
                    Many investors who seek to avoid what they consider to be unethical investments look to vehicles such as socially
                    conscious mutual funds that screen companies according to specific ethically-based criteria. Many such funds are offered
                    by religious denominations such as the Lutheran Brotherhood, which typically avoids investing in any of the "sin" industries listed above and can provide investors with a clear conscience in this area.
                    <br>
                    2. Carry out research
                    Some fund managers have strong teams looking into socially responsible investment, some aim to filter out redundant funds, while others actively invest in companies working in areas such as pollution control, clean fuel and healthcare services. Carry out research and do a background search before deciding to invest in any of the green sectors that might be of interest to you. Ethical investors favor companies that replace what they
                    take from the earth and adhere to governmental standards for emissions.
                    <br>
                    3. Consider an ethical IFA
                    If you are not comfortable choosing investment funds, consider taking some advice from ethical IFAs or look for an IFA who specialises in ethical investment.
                    <br>
                    4. Determine your attitude to risk.Review and reflect on your attitude to risk.
                    If you are a low-risk investor, you might want to avoid stocks and shares  altogether, while aggressive investors would consider investing in high-risk companies such as renewable energy start-ups.To reduce risk, diversify your funds or sectors and spread your investments around different funds, sectors or even geographical areas.
                    <br>
                    5. Choose a fund manager carefully
                    Investors should look into a manager’s ethical criteria and see if these are rigorous, or if the fund has a specialist team or if it has a position on new investment opportunities such as biofuels, organic food, climate change, waste, and water, and so on.

                        had to tell. Furthermore, we wanted to thank the whole ADA Teaching Stuff for the great job that
                        they did all along of the semester. It is certainly one of the most time consumming classes at EPFL
                        but we learn a lot of thing for the future.

<p>This first substory aims to show the general information we were able to extract from the SEC dataset.</p>

<p><strong>Used Dataset:</strong> <a href="https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?company=&amp;CIK=&amp;type=13F&amp;owner=include&amp;count=40&amp;action=getcurrent">SEC asset manager portfolios</a></p>

<p>In the histogram above, we observe the frequency at which US dollars (in millions) are invested per investor. Investors in this context, as in the rest of this data story, are large asset manager investors with holdings of at least $100M. We can see an overwhelming preference by these investors to invest under one million dollars. The frequency of investments over one million dollars is difficult to see, so we remove outliers before continuing to explore this data in the graphs below.</p>

<p><img src="/investing_for_social_good//img/portfolio/b.png" alt="Logo Jekyll" /></p>

<p>In the boxplot above, we observe the distribution of US dollars invested per investor, after the removal of outliers. We can see that the median investment is still under one million dollars; however, we can see that the interquartile range of the boxplot ranges from around half a million to three million dollars. This means that  investments of less than one million dollars are as common as those from half a million to three million dollars. Thus, by removing outliers we can see there is still a significant number of investments being made using amounts of half a million to three million dollars.</p>

<p><img src="/investing_for_social_good//img/portfolio/c.png" alt="Logo Jekyll" /></p>

<p>In the histogram above, we observe the frequency at which US dollars (in millions) are invested per investor, with outliers removed. Unlike in the previous histogram above, we can more clearly see the frequency at which amounts of US dollars greater than one million dollars are invested. we see that as the amount in US dollars increases, the frequency at which those amounts are invested tends to decrease. The frequency of US dolar amounts invested goes up slightly at five million and six to seven million dollars, but does not surpass the frequency of US dollar amounts invested at three million dollars.</p>

<p><img src="/investing_for_social_good//img/portfolio/d.png" alt="Logo Jekyll" /></p>

<p>In the boxplot above, we can see the distribution of Just Capital company social impact scores. We see, in the overall social impact score, that most companies have a score of between 40 and 60, out of 100 points, with the median being 50 points. Observe that outliers in the overall company social impact score exist above 60 points, and that conponent social impact scores (customer, environment, jobs, etc social impact component scores that feed into the overall social impact score) also have medians of around 50 points.</p>

<p><img src="/investing_for_social_good//img/portfolio/e.png" alt="Logo Jekyll" /></p>

<p>In the histogram above, we can see the frequncy of weighted portfolio-wide social impact scores per investor.</p>

<p>The weighted portfolio social score per investor is created by aggregating the individual scores of investments held by an investor on a weighted average basis according to the portfolio percentage of each investment. For example, an investor with a portfolio of stock A and stock B, where the investor’s portfolio is 40% stock A and 60% stock B, and stock A and B have social impact scores of 50 and 60 would have a weighted portfolio social impact score of 56 (40% x 50 + 60% x 60 = 56).</p>

<p>The histogram shows that most investor portfolios have a social impact score of 14 points. The frequency of investor portfolios with scores of more than 14 points drops significantly (by almost half at 15 points), and continues to drop in a linear fashion until 45 points. Thus, large asset management investors have predominantly low portfolio social impact scores.</p>

<h4 id="2017-investor-portfolios-by-social-impact">2017 Investor Portfolios by Social Impact</h4>

<iframe width="900" height="800" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="//plot.ly/~mike.jiao/10.embed"></iframe>

<p>We can observe in the 2-D Scatterplot above, focused on 2017 data, the variation in Investor Portfolio social impact amoung specific large ($100M+) asset managers. We can hover our mouse over specific data points to identify specific investors and their scores. We see from the distribution of portfolio social impact scores that  most investors have very low portfolio social impact scores (around 14 points). This is followed by smaller groups with scores higher than 20 points. This suggests that there is no clear consensus amoung the asset management community in the need for them to implement social impact maximizing or minimizing portfolio investment strategies.</p>

<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
<p>We see that, for example, the lowest scoring investor, Akanthos Capital Management, is focused on a very specialized investment strategy (event-driven investing), which operates independently of long-term social trends such as societal pressures to be more socially impactful.</p>

<p>On the other end of the spectrum, the highest scoring investor, Aetna Inc, is a healthcare company, and is thus intrensically driven to invest based on values aligned with social impact outcomes (i.e., improvements to medical technology, social services, etc).</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>After examining the specific organizations behind both the most and least socially impactful investors, on a portfolio-wide basis, we can see that the extent of their social impact can be largely explained by investor-specific attributes, such as specific profit-maximizing investment strategies, and organizational values. This suggests that the lack of a clear consensus amoung asset managers towards the need to make explicitly social-impact oriented decisions comes from a lack of motivation to make such decisions. Given the lack of transparency public stakeholders have into the investment activities and social impact of asset managers, it is not surprising for us to see that asset managers are not motivated as a whole to consider social impact explicitly in their investment strategies, even as public stakeholder support of social impact investments grows.</p>

<p>This data substory aims to understand the types of investments asset management investors favor, and to examine the motivations behind asset manager’s investments into the best and worst social impact investments.</p>

<p>###The Ethical Puzzle</p>

<p>Although the definition of ethical investing could be stated as simply purchasing investments from issuers who act ethically, 
investors who seek to achieve this must first establish a set of criteria that can be used to determine what actions and 
practices are considered ethical to them. For example, the Bible and other religious books provide rules and principles for
 people to live by, and those who believe what those books say use them as guides to evaluate things in the world around them. 
 Religious texts and other moral teachings, however, do not always provide crystal-clear guidance for practical investment decisions.
Although creating or finding the ethical criteria to use as the basis for evaluating investments may often be relatively simple, 
effectively applying that criteria to actual investment choices can be more difficult. For instance, the Bible condemns 
drunkenness in several passages, but does this then make it unconditionally wrong to purchase securities issued by makers of 
alcoholic beverages? Since not all consumers of alcohol get drunk, then the investor will have to decide for him or herself 
whether this investment truly supports immoral behavior. Virtually all issuers of securities or investments most likely do 
something that at least a substantial percentage of their investors do not approve of (how many investors who buy Treasury 
securities approve of everything that is done by the government?). Of course, this begs the question of which practices and 
policies are tolerable for investors and which are not.</p>

<h3 id="assets">Assets</h3>
<p>According to the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), a <strong>financial asset</strong> can be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Cash or cash equivalent,</li>
  <li>Equity instruments of another entity,</li>
  <li>Contractual right to receive cash or another financial asset from another entity or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another entity under conditions that are potentially favourable to the entity,</li>
  <li>A contract that will or may be settled in the entity’s own equity instruments and is either a non-derivative for which the entity is or may be obliged to receive a variable number of the entity’s own equity instruments, or a derivative that will or may be settled other than by exchange of a fixed amount of cash or another financial asset for a fixed number of the entity’s own equity instruments.</li>
</ul>

<p>The heatmap shows the most and least popular “ethical” investments held by asset managers. It shows the number of investors in 2017 for each stock that scored within the top 10% of Just Capital Social Impact stocks, where stocks scoring in the top 10% of Just Capital Social Impact scores are labeled “ethical”. 
Said slightly differently, the heatmap displays the social impact (scored by Just Capital) of each stock within the top 10% of Just Capital Social Impact Scores, as well as the number of large institutional investors (with at least 100M in US 13F type securities) that own that stock. 
More popular stocks are represented by lighter colours, whereas less popular stocks are represented with darker colours. 
Although the top 10% of Just Capital Social Impact Scores corresponds to 87 stocks, only 43 stocks are shown in this heatmap. This is because half of these stocks are not held by any large asset manager investor.</p>

<p>The heatmap follows an identical format to the previous heatmap, and shows the most and least popular “unethical” investments held by asset managers. These stocks correspond to bottom 10% of Just Capital Social Impact Scores.</p>

<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>

<h3 id="high-impact-stock-popularity-observations">High Impact Stock Popularity Observations</h3>

<p>We can see that <strong>technology companies</strong>, as an industry category, are the most popular “ethical” investments held by asset managers. A large number of stocks shown in the <em>Popularity of High Social Impact Stocks</em> plot represent technology companies, including Apple (APPL) with a social impact score of 59.97005 and 1181 large asset manager investors, and Microsoft (MSFT) with a social impact score of 68.55428 and 948 large asset manager investors.</p>

<p>Another popular type of high impact stock are Blue Chip stocks (stocks with a history of reliable returns that are highly trusted by the larger investment industry) such as Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) with a social impact score of 59.94658 and 833 large asset manager investors, and Nike (NKE) also appear.</p>

<p>We also notice that there is an uneven distribution of stocks within the highest social impact stocks. Although the top 10% of social impact stocks have social impact scores ranging from 53 to 70, few stocks exist in the upper half of this range, with scores higher than 63 points.</p>

<h3 id="low-impact-stock-popularity-observations">Low Impact Stock Popularity Observations</h3>
<p>We can see that <strong>companies employing large, less educated labour forces</strong> are the most popular “unethical” investments held by asset managers. As shown in the <em>Popularity of Low Social Impact Stocks</em> plot, these include a large number of manufacturing and retail companies, including Tesla (TSLA) with a score of 45.05744 and 66 large asset manager investors, Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company (GT) with a score of 45.96831 and 15 large asset manager investors, and TJX Companies (TJX) with a score of 44.58723 and 67 large asset manager investors.</p>

<p>Similar to the <em>Popularity of High Social Impact Stocks</em> plot, Blue Chip stocks once again appear. These include stocks such as Sourthern Co (SO) with a social impact score of 44.58723 and 32 large asset manager investors, and Stryker Corporation (SYK).</p>

<p>We notice that large asset manager investors in general hold far fewer stocks in this category, with each stock individual stock having lower numbers of investors. There are also less stocks displayed in the <em>Popularity of Low Social Impact Stocks</em> plot compared to the <em>Popularity of High Social Impact Stocks</em> plot because many stocks (80%) in the bottom 10% of Just Capital Social Impact Scores are not held by any large asset manager investors.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Although the values and beliefs that guide ethically minded investors differ somewhat for each person, there are several 
specific areas where ethics play a major role. According to our results the most popular “ethical” investments are technology 
companies, with the most popular “unethical” investments being companies that employ large, uneducated labour forces such as manufacturing and retail companies. Blue Chip stocks also appear widely in both high and low impact stock lists. We observe, as an overall pattern, that large asset manager investors hold greater numbers of high impact stocks. However, we acknowledge that the technology companies that dominate the rankings of high social impact stocks have also dominated the financial markets in terms of returns on investment. Thus, an investor could easily end up selecting a portfolio with more high social impact investments simply based on looking for stocks with high historical financial growth - technology companies such as Amazon and Apple.</p>

<p>The 3-D scatterplot shows the portfolio-wide social impact of institutional investors with over $100M in holdings in a sample of three years between 2013 and 2018 (2013, 2015, and 2017). Portfolio-wide social impact is measured using a score computed as a weighted average of a portfolio’s individual stocks’ social impact. The score is computed using the portfolio weight percentage of each stock declared in SEC 13F filings, and individual stock social impact scores computed by Just Capital.</p>

<p>We can see in this visualization the lack changes in portfolio social impact for the asset management industry as a whole (while some individual investors may have changes in their portfolio social impact, investors as an aggregate still result in roughly the same levels of social impact year over year.</p>

<iframe width="900" height="800" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="//plot.ly/~mike.jiao/25.embed"></iframe>

<p>The Scatterplot displays how the social impact of investor portfolios has changed from 2013 to 2017. In particular, this visualization allows us to see how specific investor portfolio social impact levels have changed year to year by configuring the 5 layers of data traces provided.</p>

<p>The graph has 5 layers/traces that can be optionally displayed or removed from the plot by clicking the respective item in the Legend on the top right hand corner of the plot.</p>

<p>Using these different layers, you can see how the Social Impact of the best and worst Social Impact Investors has changed, or not changed between 2013 and 2017.</p>

<p>For example, if you choose to display the “2017 Investors by Social Impact Scores” in combination with the “Lowest Scoring 2017 Investors in 2013”, you can compare how investors have changed their portfolios in terms of social impact between 2013 and 2017.</p>

<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>

<p>We can see that investors do not seem to be, as a general trend, shifting towards higher social impact investments. There are very few investors have relatively high social impact scores, with the majority of investors having relatively much lower scores.</p>

<p>We observe that the highest portfolio social impact scores correspond to Mirae Asset Global Investments (2013), a $400B Korean Financial Services Group, Rehmann Capital Advisory Group (2015), a Wealth Management Advisory (for high networth individuals), and AETNA INC /PA/ (2017), a Healthcare Company.</p>

<p>We also observe that the lowest portfolio social impact score (all scores of 0) come from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=133257895">Index Management Solutions, LLC (2013)</a> and <a href="http://waterinv.com/">Water Asset Management, LCC (2015)</a> - Land and Buildings Investment Management, LCC (2017).</p>

<p>Notice that the highest and lowest scoring investors are all relatively small, LLC, specialized investors focused on very specific verticals such as Water Storage, Real Estate, and investment services. It it likely that larger investors hold more broadly diversified portfolios that reduce their overall correlation to social impact score variables.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>It seems like while a small minority of investors have adopted specialized strategies towards increasing social impact, most have not decided that predominantly social impact oriented portfolios related to successful investment returns. There does not seem to be an overall transition towards social impact investing. Although we can definitely see that the the largest, most successful investors are not among the worst at investing for social impact, this may be due to for example owning larger numbers of successful technology company stocks such as Apple and Microsoft that also tend to have produced incredibly high financial returns, instead of deliberate efforts to adopt investment portfolios that are more socially impactful.</p>

<p>We also conclude that large investors have greater pressures to diversify their portfolios of investments (not owning all the same types of stocks) due to the need to reduce investment risk (likelihood of all stocks in a portfolio simultaneously dropping in value). Thus, it is understandable that it is rare for the largest asset managers to have portfolios with the highest or lowest social impact scores. This logic also explains why it is difficult for the largest asset managers, who need to keep their portfolios sufficiantly diversified, to make significant year over year changes to their portfolio-wide social impact.</p>

                            <br>
                            <p> <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Public opinion is a important criteria to choose a investment. In fact, each investement will be a part of the identity of the investor and public opinion could really sustain some investment and criticize others.
It is thus interesting to correlate the greater public’s interest into social good projects expressed on social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook, or news platforms, with the actual investments that are done. 
To add the public opinion part, sentiment analysis was done on tweet from 2017. In fact, sentiment analysis is contextual mining of text which identifies and extracts subjective information in source material, and helping a business to understand the social sentiment of their brand, product or service while monitoring online conversations. In this part of the data story, the text classifier process tool was used to analyses an incoming message and tells whether the underlying sentiment is positive, negative our neutral.</p>

<p><strong>Used Dataset:</strong> The raw dataset was composed of all the tweets from 2017. 
First of all, output of the last part where taken and mix with a new dataset which is the Twitter dataset given in the course. It contains the tweets of 2017 and it’s store on the ADA cluster. The documentation of Twitter API was analyzed to understand how to use this database. The group decided to work on a selected part of the entire dataset. In fact, our goal is to score the public’s opinion of compagnies thanks to a sentiment analysis done over tweets of 2017. To do that we decide to take just tweet corresponding to 3 days per month. English tweets were filter as our analysis is made on Americans compagnies. We thus care more about the public opinion of English speaking population as they are more impacted by theses compagnies. For each month, we take always the same days : the 1th, the 11th one and the 21th. Then a preprocessing part corresponding to the cleaning of the tweets and the creation of dictionaries was done. Moreover, we link each tweets to compagny. To do that a easy rule was used : a tweet concerned a company if the name of the company is present in the tweet text or in the tweet tags.</p>

<h2 id="research-question">Research Question</h2>
<p>How to make a ranking of “public opinion” regarding a company?
What is the great public’s opinion regarding the companies and investors ? 
Just capital ranking is one thing. This metrics is complex and tries to take into account a high number of variables. But it just capital score correlated with public opinion ? It means that we will try to understand the public’s opinion regarding the companies that held many investments in social good versus those who do not invest in social good?</p>

<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>

<p>Unfortunatly, in this sentiment analysis, some bias can be highlighted.
First of all, with the twitter dataset consisted of the tweet from 2017 we wanted to gives a indication of the public opinion per compagnies/investors. Therefore, we did not need to take the data from everyday. It was decided that it would be wiser and sufficient to take 10-days samples through the year 2017. This made the calculation feasible in Pandas. Since we were looking for information about investors and companies in the USA, we decided to only look at the tweet in English. This reduces the number of tweet per day by roughly 70% the majority of the Tweet are written in the mother tongue of the user (Chinese, Japanese, German, …). All theses assumptions can create bias.
Moreover, to link tweets and and compagnies/investors names, we search in tweets text and tags the name of the corresponding actors. This method makes senses but as language is a really complex process with a lot of possibilities, some tweets corresponding to one categorical compagny/investor could have not being linked.
To conlude this discussion, fastText method gives labels from 1 (negative sentence) to 5 (positive sentence) which is not a score between -1 and 1. Thus, we decide to add this labels number as integer and do a mean. In fact we choose the mean to penalized well extreme values. This way of creating a score can introduce a bias as the method is not made for that. Scores for actors with one tweet would be less robust than with several tweets.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>By having all theses potential bias in mind, we could draw conclusion from the analysis of the results.</p>

<p>Thanks to the provious substories. We were able to rank assets according to their “social good” value. All these companies 
certainly come from different states in the US and we wanted to know if certain regions of the USA have more asseets invested
in social good project. For instance one could think that innovative regions like California should have higher investments 
than states which are know for their large amount of conservative people.</p>

<p><strong>Used Dataset:</strong> <a href="https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?company=&amp;CIK=&amp;type=13F&amp;owner=include&amp;count=40&amp;action=getcurrent">SEC asset manager portfolios</a></p>

<h2 id="research-question">Research Question</h2>
<p>Where are the most ethical assets?</p>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<iframe width="900" height="800" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="//plot.ly/~dcleres/21.embed"></iframe>

<p>First, one could easily see from the graph that some regions of the US do not have any company listed as having assets of 
sufficiently high value to be considered in our ranking (see the white state on the maps were no information pops up while
passing the mouse over the map). 
The scores of the different states are heterogeneous. There is no cleat trend to observe. 
Furthermore, one could observe that our hypothesis was wrong. The Sate of Idaho has the highest social score according to our 
criteria, followed by Indiana, Washington and Colorado. The State of California is only in the midfield of our ranking. 
The States of Texas, Missouri or Nebraska have score bellow 1.5 in our ranking.</p>

<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
<p>Considering the low score of States like Texas, Missouri or Nebraska which are renown for the high influence of 
their conservative party, we can observe a certain trend that the States in the center of the US struggle more to invest 
in Social Good assets then the states on the Coast.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>It is not just because a given State has many start-ups or a young population that the Companies of a given State will have
larger amount of their portfolio invested in social good. It could be interesting to compare the plot that we generated with 
the last elections in the USA in order to see if there is a trend or not.</p>
