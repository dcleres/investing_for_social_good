                        Asset managers are increasingly challenged by their investors to manage their portfolios for social
                        impact. However, it is non-trivial for investors and investment managers to maintain regular
                        oversight over the social impact composition of their portfolios. The U.S. Securities and
                        Exchange Commission’s (SEC’s) EDGAR maintains a digital record of the portfolio filings of
                        publicly traded asset managers.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        One way to track at which extent the investors, and to a greater extent, the great public is interested in social good
                        projects is by analysing the data from social media platforms such as Twitter. With this information,
                        one could also link the social opinion about a given company and how much the enterprise invests in
                        social good.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In this research project, the term social good was defined according to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG).
                        These SDG where defined are a collection of 17 global goals set by the United Nations General Assembly in 2015.
                        They aim to "transform our World: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development." That has been shortened to "2030 Agenda."
                        The goals are broad and interdependent, yet each has a separate list of targets to achieve.
                        Achieving all 169 targets would signal accomplishing all 17 goals. The SDGs cover social and
                        economic development issues including poverty, hunger, health, education, global warming,
                        gender equality, water, sanitation, energy, urbanization, environment and social justice.
                        In the frame of this project, investments in social good were defined as being an investment in
                        any of the 17 different goals stated by the United Nations.
                        <br>

                        From these SDG's, we decided to put the focus on three following major targets:

                            America's ranking for the most just companies. JUST Capital measures and ranks companies on
                            the issues Americans care about most so the Americans can then act on that knowledge.
                            The aim is to influence purchase decisions, investment dollars, career choices of the people
                            that are living and working in the US. Thus people should have the power to make the world a more just place.
                            <br>
                            JUST Capital was co-founded in 2013 by a group of people from the world of business, finance,
                            and civil society. The organization as a not-for-profit registered charity, the founders
                            ensured that JUST Capital would be exclusively geared towards achieving its mission. JUST Capital
                            ranking annually all the companies in the US in their annual report.

                            This ranking was then used by our group as a factor for the <i>Social Good</i> score of each company.
                            Details about the calculation of this score are given bellow in the <i>The Ethics of Investing</i>

                    <h4 class="introduction-heading">
                        <p style="text-align:justify">
                            For this project, two datatsets were used. The first dataset consisted of the
                            <a href="https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?company=&CIK=&type=13F&owner=include&count=40&action=getcurrent">U.S. Securities
                                and Exchange Commission (SEC)</a> archives. It was possible generate a
                            .csv-like file listing, by company and date since the URLs in the SEC's archives, where the
                            investment portfolio filings are stored, has consistently structured text and HTML table data.
                            We were able to automate the extraction and so to get the type and scope of different types of asset
                            manager investment holdings (what companies they invested in, the size and value of each investment).
                            This data can be enriched by processing additional social data from twitter related to portfolio companies
                            into signals of their social impact and mapping these social impact signals to investment portfolios.
                            <br>
                            Based on this data from investment portfolio filings, we could identify and analyze investments
                            made in companies that pursue goals related to social good from all different kinds of industries.
                            <br>
                            Nevertheless, one need to be careful with the interpretation of the data. This data set contained
                            biases that one need to be aware of before drawing general conclusions from the data.
                            First, the data is collected quarterly and contains information about all the major players
                            of the US stock market. It would have been interesting to have the same kind of information
                            about Switzerland and the rest of the world also. However, the SEC dataset was the most
                            complete and consistent information we were able to find. Therefore, any conclusion that we could
                            make is likely to be true from the USA but not necessarily for the rest of the world. <br>

                            Secondly, the dataset contains only the institutional investment managers with holdings over 100M <br>

                            Furthermore, the <i>13F form</i> is required to be filed within 45 days of the end of a calendar quarter
                            (which should be considered as significant information latency) only reports long positions
                            (not short) different investment managers pursue different strategies with may bias results.
                            However, the vast majority of investment managers rely significantly on long positions for significant
                            portion of fund performance. <br>

                            Another drawback is that the 13F form does not reveal international holdings (except for
                            American depositary receipts) and excludes total portfolio value and percentage allocation of
                            each stock listed <br>

                            The Section 13(f) securities generally include equity securities that trade on an exchange (including Nasdaq),
                            certain equity options and warrants, shares of closed-end investment companies, and certain convertible debt securities.
                            Shares of open-end investment companies (i.e. mutual funds) are not Section 13(f) securities

                            Finally, it is necessery to point out at 13F does not represent the whole portfolio of the investos - it's a past snapshot.

                            that it would be wiser and sufficient to take 10-days samples through the year 2017. This made
                            the calculation feasible in Pandas.
                            Since we were looking for information about investors and companies in the USA, we decided to
                            only look at the tweet in English. This reduces the number of tweet per day by roughly 70% the majority
                            of the Tweet are written in the mother tongue of the user (Chinese, Japanese, German, ...)

                    In order to give some deeper insights to the information that we generated but also to make our workflow
                    easier to understand for the reader, we decided to split our data story in smaller data stories
                    called <i>substories</i> which are linked. The substories were set up in such a way that they all
                    answer one of our research questions. In fact, the whole substory in built around this question.
                    The first part of the substory is used to introduce and state the problem that we want to answer and
                    why it is interesting to studies this topic. These introduction should serve as teaser for the reader.
                    The used dataset is also explicitly mentioned in each document. This should make it possible for the
                    reader to eventually reproduce our experiments or at least to understand which dataset and which part of
                    it was used to get the information that we want to show. Finally, the major part of the substory is
                    obviously dedicated to the graphs that we produced to answer the research question. Each graph comes
                    with a description of the phenomena but also with an interpretation of the results in order to conclude
                    something from the data regarding the research question.

                <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted">
                    1. Consider what ethical means.
                    There are many different criteria of “ethical” under which to categorise a fund and businesses that involve nuclear energy, animal testing or tobacco are some of the commonly screened-out industries when people are thinking of ethical investment. But before you can sensibly choose an investment fund that may match your profile, you need to ask yourself if you are against an alleged cause for a higher purpose or just for the sake of going against it.
                    <br>
                    2. Carry out research.
                    Some fund managers have strong teams looking into socially responsible investment, some aim to filter out redundant funds, while others actively invest in companies working in areas such as pollution control, clean fuel and healthcare services. Carry out research and do a background search before deciding to invest in any of the green sectors that might be of interest to you.
                    <br>
                    3. Consider an ethical IFA.
                    If you are not comfortable choosing investment funds, consider taking some advice from ethical IFAs or look for an IFA who specialises in ethical investment.
                    <br>
                    4. Determine your attitude to risk.Review and reflect on your attitude to risk.
                    If you are a low-risk investor, you might want to avoid stocks and shares  altogether, while aggressive investors would consider investing in high-risk companies such as renewable energy start-ups.To reduce risk, diversify your funds or sectors and spread your investments around different funds, sectors or even geographical areas.
                    <br>
                    5. Choose a fund manager carefully.
                    Investors should look into a manager’s ethical criteria and see if these are rigorous, or if the fund has a specialist team or if it has a position on new investment opportunities such as biofuels, organic food, climate change, waste, and water, and so on.

                        We wanted to take this opportunity to thank you as a reader for taking the time to read what we
                        had to tell. Furthermore, we wanted to thank the whole ADA Teaching Stuff for the great job that
                        they did all along of the semester. It is certainly one of the most time consumming classes at EPFL
                        but we learn a lot of thing for the future.

<p>According to the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), a <strong>financial asset</strong> can be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Cash or cash equivalent,</li>
  <li>Equity instruments of another entity,</li>
  <li>Contractual right to receive cash or another financial asset from another entity or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another entity under conditions that are potentially favourable to the entity,</li>
  <li>A contract that will or may be settled in the entity’s own equity instruments and is either a non-derivative for which the entity is or may be obliged to receive a variable number of the entity’s own equity instruments, or a derivative that will or may be settled other than by exchange of a fixed amount of cash or another financial asset for a fixed number of the entity’s own equity instruments.</li>

<iframe width="900" height="800" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="//plot.ly/~mike.jiao/12.embed"></iframe>

<p>The heatmap shows the most and least popular “ethical” investments held by asset managers. It shows the number of investors in 2017 for each stock that scored within the top 10% of Just Capital Social Impact stocks, where stocks scoring in the top 10% of Just Capital Social Impact scores are labeled “ethical”. 
Said slightly differently, the heatmap displays the social impact (scored by Just Capital) of each stock within the top 10% of Just Capital Social Impact Scores, as well as the number of large institutional investors (with at least 100M in US 13F type securities) that own that stock. 
More popular stocks are represented by lighter colours, whereas less popular stocks are represented with darker colours. 
Although the top 10% of Just Capital Social Impact Scores corresponds to 87 stocks, only 43 stocks are shown in this heatmap. This is because half of these stocks are not held by any large asset manager investor. 
Notice that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Technology companies, as an industry category, are the most popular “ethical” investments held by asset managers. A large number of stocks shown in this plot represent technology companies, including Apple (APPL) with a social impact score of 59.97005 and 1181 large asset manager investors, and Microsoft (MSFT) with a social impact score of 68.55428 and 948 large asset manager investors.</li>
  <li>Blue Chip stocks such as Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) with a social impact score of 59.94658 and 833 large asset manager investors, and Nike (NKE) also appear.</li>
  <li>Even with a range of stock social impact scores from 53 to 70, few stocks have scores higher than 63</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="popularity-of-low-social-impact-stocks">Popularity of Low Social Impact Stocks</h4>
<p>The heatmap shows the most and least popular “unethical” investments held by asset managers. Correspond to bottom 10% of Just Capital Social Impact Scores. 
Notice that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Large asset manager investors in general hold far fewer stocks in this category
    <ul>
      <li>each stock has a lower number of investors</li>
      <li>there are also less stocks displayed compared to the top ethical stocks</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Many stocks (80%) in the bottom 10% of Just Capital Social Impact Scores are not held by any large asset manager investors</li>
  <li>Interesting to find Tesla (TSLA) with a score of 45.05744 and 66 large asset manager investors</li>

<p>The 3-D scatterplot shows the portfolio-wide social impact of institutional investors with over 100M in holders in a sample of three years between 2013 and 2018 (2013, 2015, and 2017). Portfolio-wide social impact is measured using a score computed as a weighted average of a portfolio’s individual stocks’ social impact. The score is computed using the portfolio weight percentage of each stock declared in SEC 13F filings, and individual stock social impact scores computed by Just Capital. 
Observations include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Investors do not seem to be, as a general trend, shifting towards higher social impact investments</li>
  <li>Very few investors have relatively high social impact scores, with the majority of investors having relatively much lower scores</li>
  <li>Highest portfolio social impact score:
    <ul>
      <li>Mirae Asset Global Investments (2013) - 400B Korean Financial Services Group</li>
      <li>Rehmann Capital Advisory Group (2015) - Wealth Management Advisory (high networth individuals)</li>
      <li>AETNA INC /PA/ (2017) - Healthcare Company</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Lowest portfolio social impact score (all scores of 0):
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=133257895">Index Management Solutions, LLC (2013)</a></li>
      <li>
        <p><a href="http://waterinv.com/">Water Asset Management, LCC (2015)</a> - Land and Buildings Investment Management, LCC (2017)</p>
      </li>
      <li>Notice that these investors are all relatively small, LLC, specialized investors focused on very specific verticals such as Water Storage, Real Estate, and investment services</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="investor-social-impact-in-2013-vs-2017">Investor Social Impact in 2013 vs 2017</h4>
<iframe width="900" height="800" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="//plot.ly/~mike.jiao/25.embed"></iframe>

<p>The Scatterplot displays how the social impact of investor portfolios has changed from 2013 to 2017. The graph has 5 layers/traces that can be optionally displayed or removed from the plot by clicking the respective item in the Legend. 
These layers in order from top to bottom correspond with 1) All 2017 Investor Portfolio Social Impact Scores, 2) 2017 
Investor Portfolio Social Impact Scores for the top 10% of Investors by Portfolio Social Impact Score from 2013, 3) 2017 
Investor Portfolio Social Impact Scores for the bottom 10% of Investors by Portfolio Social Impact Score from 2013, 4) 2013 Investor Portfolio Social Impact Scores for the top 10% of Investors by Portfolio Social Impact Score in 2017, and 5) 2013 Investor Portfolio Social Impact Scores for the bottom 10% of Investors by Portfolio Social Impact Score in 2017.
Using these different layers, you can see how the Social Impact of the best and worst Social Impact Investors has changed, or not changed between 2013 and 2017.</p>

<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>It seems like while a small minority of investors have adopted specialized strategies towards increasing social impact, most have not decided that predominantly social impact oriented portfolios related to successful investment returns. There does not seem to be an overall transition towards social impact investing. Although we can definitely see that the the largest, most successful investors are not among the worst at investing for social impact, this may be due to for example owning larger numbers of successful technology company stocks such as Apple and Microsoft that also tend to have produced incredibly high financial returns, instead of deliberate efforts to adopt investment portfolios that are more socially impactful.</p>

                            <p><strong> Abstract:  </strong> Dictionaries list several different definitions for the word "ethics." The primary definition is a system of moral principles, and a secondary definition is that ethics are the rules of conduct as used by a specific group or culture. The final definition of ethics is a branch of philosophy dealing with values relating to human conduct, with respect to the right and wrong of certain actions and their respective motives and consequences. The proper application of ethics to investments is a highly subjective topic that can raise some difficult questions for both investors and regulatory agencies.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p> <h1 id="introduction-to-the-ethical-puzzle">Introduction to the Ethical Puzzle</h1>
<p>Although the definition of ethical investing could be stated as simply purchasing investments from issuers who act ethically, investors who seek to achieve this must first establish a set of criteria that can be used to determine what actions and practices are considered ethical to them. For example, the Bible and other religious books provide rules and principles for people to live by, and those who believe what those books say use them as guides to evaluate things in the world around them. Religious texts and other moral teachings, however, do not always provide crystal-clear guidance for practical investment decisions.
Although creating or finding the ethical criteria to use as the basis for evaluating investments may often be relatively simple, effectively applying that criteria to actual investment choices can be more difficult. For instance, the Bible condemns drunkenness in several passages, but does this then make it unconditionally wrong to purchase securities issued by makers of alcoholic beverages? Since not all consumers of alcohol get drunk, then the investor will have to decide for him or herself whether this investment truly supports immoral behavior. Virtually all issuers of securities or investments most likely do something that at least a substantial percentage of their investors do not approve of (how many investors who buy Treasury securities approve of everything that is done by the government?). Of course, this begs the question of which practices and policies are tolerable for investors and which are not.</p>

<p>Ethical Issues
Although the values and beliefs that guide ethically minded investors differ somewhat for each person, there are several specific areas where ethics play a major role. Some of the more notable issues that investors examine from an ethical standpoint include:</p>

<p>Winning at Someone Else’s Expense
Although there will inevitably be both winners and losers in a free-market economy, the issue of how a company wins is a concern to some. Companies that have monopolies in a market or industry can function very efficiently in many respects, but they also effectively prevent any form of healthy business competition, and some investors consider this to be unethical.</p>

<p>Environmental Responsibility
Heavy industry such as energy and manufacturing have long been perceived as destroyers of nature and wildlife with their pollution and decimation of forests, oceans, lakes and rivers. Ethical investors favor companies that replace what they take from the earth and adhere to governmental standards for emissions.</p>

<p>Abortion and Stem-Cell Research
Companies that profit from certain medical procedures or types of research are often considered to be unethical or even criminal by those in the Judeo-Christian community.</p>

<p>“Sin” Industries
Although the concept of an industry being sinful is obviously somewhat subjective, a portion of the investing public still considers makers of alcoholic beverages, tobacco companies, casinos and the pornography industry to be taboo. The tobacco industry, for instance, has long been accused of targeting teenagers as customers and making its products as addictive as possible in order to fuel sales. While sin industries have made efforts to raise public awareness of the dangers of misusing their products and services, some investors may choose to avoid companies that operate in these industries.</p>

<p>Socially Conscious Investing
Many investors who seek to avoid what they consider to be unethical investments look to vehicles such as socially conscious mutual funds that screen companies according to specific ethically-based criteria. Many such funds are offered by religious denominations such as the Lutheran Brotherhood, which typically avoids investing in any of the “sin” industries listed above and can provide investors with a clear conscience in this area.</p>

                            <p> <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Public opinion is a important criteria to choose a investement. In fact, each investement will be a part of the identity of the inve stor and public opinion could really sustain some investement and criticize others.
It is thus interesting to correlate the greater public’s interest into social good projects expressed on social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook, or news platforms, with the actual investments that are done. 
To add the public opinion part, sentiment analysis was done on tweet from 2017. In fact, sentiment analysis is contextual mining of text which identifies and extracts subjective information in source material, and helping a business to understand the social sentiment of their brand, product or service while monitoring online conversations. In this part of the data story, the text classifier process tool was used to analyses an incoming message and tells whether the underlying sentiment is positive, negative our neutral.</p>

<p><strong>Used Dataset:</strong> The raw dataset was composed of all the tweets from 2017. 
First of all, output of the last part where taken and mix with a new dataset which is the Twitter dataset given in the course. It contains the tweets of 2017 and it’s store on the ADA cluster. The documentation of Twitter API was analyzed to understand how to use this database. The group decided to work on a selected part of the entire dataset. In fact, our goal is to score the public’s opinion of compagnies thanks to a sentiment analysis done over tweets of 2017. To do that we decide to take just tweet corresponding to 3 days per month. English tweets were filter as our analysis is made on Americans compagnies. We thus care more about the public opinion of English speaking population as they are more impacted by theses compagnies. For each month, we take always the same days : the 1th, the 11th one and the 21th. Then a preprocessing part corresponding to the cleaning of the tweets and the creation of dictionaries was done. Moreover, we link each tweets to compagny. To do that a easy rule was used : a tweet concerned a company if the name of the company is present in the tweet text or in the tweet tags.</p>

<h2 id="research-question">Research Question</h2>
<p>How to make a ranking of “public opinion” regarding a company?
What is the great public’s opinion regarding the companies and investors ? 
Just capital ranking is one thing. This metrics is complex and tries to take into account a high number of variables. But it just capital score correlated with public opinion ? It means that we will try to understand the public’s opinion regarding the companies that held many investments in social good versus those who do not invest in social good?</p>
